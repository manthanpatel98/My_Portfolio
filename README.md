## [**Project 8: COVID-19 Detection (X-ray Images):**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Covid-19-Detection)
* Dataset of X-ray Images are taken from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset)
* Here, I have manually chosen images of Covid-19 and Normal State.
* Entire model is trained on total around **400 images**.
* For testing, I have used around **50 images**.
* A Proper **explanation of model** is also given.

## [**Project 7: Data Extraction of Movies/TV Shows:**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Web-Scrapping-Movie-Data)

* Here, I have used **bs4** (BeautifulSoup) library for **Extracting Movie/TV Show Data**.
* **MongoDB** is used to store the data in database.
* Information like **'Title'**,**'Time Period'**,**'Rating'**,**'Genre'**,**'Duration'**,**'Votes'**,**'Directors'**,**'Stars'** and **'Description'** are extracted.
* These information are collected for **60,000+ Movies/TV Shows**.
* For more understanding of the project, refer [IMDB-Movies(60000)-Web-Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Web-Scrapping-Movie-Data/blob/master/IMDB-Movies(60000)-Web-Scrapping.ipynb)

* Finally, I have created [**Data Visualization with PowerBI**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Web-Scrapping-Movie-Data) for this data.

## [**Project 6: Website Checker**](https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Website-Checker)
* The Dataset has **2453 rows** and **31 columns**.
* It has 31 **columns:**
'having_IP_Address', 'URL_Length', 'Shortining_Service',
 'having_At_Symbol', 'double_slash_redirecting', 'Prefix_Suffix',
       'having_Sub_Domain', 'SSLfinal_State', 'Domain_registeration_length',
       'Favicon', 'port', 'HTTPS_token', 'Request_URL', 'URL_of_Anchor',
       'Links_in_tags', 'SFH', 'Submitting_to_email', 'Abnormal_URL',
       'Redirect', 'on_mouseover', 'RightClick', 'popUpWidnow', 'Iframe',
       'age_of_domain', 'DNSRecord', 'web_traffic', 'Page_Rank',
       'Google_Index', 'Links_pointing_to_page', 'Statistical_report',
       'Result'
* From the Dataset, we have to predict is the website **Phishing** website or not.
* **ExtraTreesClassifier** has been used for Feature Selection.
* I have applied **Artificial Neural Network**, **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, **K-NN**, **Naive bayes classification**, **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** algorithms but at the end, **RandomForestClassifier** gave better results.

### **Web App on Heroku:** The Project is no longer available on Heroku
